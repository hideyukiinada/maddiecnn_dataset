# Maddie CNN Dataset

## Terms
This repository contains the dataset for Maddie CNN.  All the photos were taken by me and I reserve the copyright.

Here are the terms if you want to download or use any of the photos:
1) Use is restricted for non-commercial purpose only.  This restriction also applies to using a photo from the dataset to train your model.
2) Publication or re-distribution of image or images in any form is not allowed without my written consent.

## Where to put image files
After unzipping the zip file in dataset/256 directory, I recommend moving some of the files to dataset/256.test directory.  files_to_move_to_test_dir.txt contains the list of files that I moved to 256.test for testing the performance of prediction against images that are not in the training set.
